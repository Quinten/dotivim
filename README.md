# dotvim

This is my (basic) vim configuration.
The idea was taken from http://stackoverflow.com/a/18203545

To install on a new machine:
Make sure you have backed up the .vimrc file and .vim folder if it's not your machine.
Then run the following commands:

    cd
    git clone git@github.com:Quinten/dotvim.git .vim
    echo "runtime vimrc" > .vimrc

This repository has submodules. You still need to run:

    cd .vim
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
